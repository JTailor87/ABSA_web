3. **TestNG Integration:**
    - Integrates TestNG for flexible test management, parallel execution, and reporting.

4. **Allure Reporting:**
    - Generates detailed and visually appealing Allure reports for better test insights.

5. **Extent Reporting:**
    - Generates detailed and visually appealing Extent html emailable reports for better test insights.

6. **Page Object Model (POM):**
    - Implements the Page Object Model pattern for improved code organization and maintainability.

7. **Parameterization and Configuration:**
    - Easily parameterize tests and configure the framework to suit your needs.

8. **Parallel Execution:**
    - Run tests in parallel to reduce execution time and increase efficiency.

9. **Easy Setup and Configuration:**
   - Quick and simple setup with clear configuration options.


## Prerequisites

- Java JDK (version 18)
- Maven (version 3.1.0)
- Cucumber (version 7.4.1)
- TestNG (7.7.1)
- allure-cucumber7-jvm (2.19.0)
- Extent report (5.0.4)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   https://github.com/JTailor87/ABSA_web
2. Run below commands.

   ```shell
   cd your-testing-framework
   mvn clean install

3. Install Allure Report
   ```shell
   npm install allure-commandline --save-dev

## Tests

- In `src/main/java/org/example/factory/DriverFactory.java` the chrome version is hardcoded. Currently is `119.0.6045.160`.
- If you don't want to hardcode then remove the `.browserVersion("119.0.6045.160")` from `src/main/java/org/example/factory/DriverFactory.java`. By doing this if `driverManager` won't pik up your current chrome version automatically then you can hardcode the chrome version as above.
- Open `src/test/java/runner/testRunner.java`
- Run `testRunner` class
- If you want to run test parallely by opening browser instance at a time, change the `@DataProvider(parallel = false)` to `true` and run the `testRunner` class.
- You can run the tests as per the tag provided for the scenarios in `src/test/resources/Features/ABSA.feature` file. You need to change the tag name in `src/test/java/Runner/MyTestRunner.java` file. The tag `@ABSA` will run both tests togather.
- If you want to run the tests in different browser, for example Firefox then change the `src/test/resources/Configs/config.properties` into `browser = Firefox`.

## Reporting

- After running the tests successfully, open terminal window in your IDE.
- Run below command.
   ```shell
  allure serve target/allure-results
- Cucumber html report will be found here `target/cucumber-reports.html`
- Extent report wil be found here `target/SparkReport 29-Nov-23 10-26-28/Reports/Spark.html`
  <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold">NOTE:</span> <span style="color:yellow">The date in the path will change. Always do mvn clean and then run the tests.</span>
- If any test case fails, the screenshot of that instance will capture in the report.
